![@mafo5/ng-ref CI](https://github.com/mafo5/exampleAppAngular/workflows/@mafo5/ng-ref%20CI/badge.svg)

A collection of wrapper from browser specific elements like `window`.

Use these wrapper to enable testablity to elments using those browser specific elements without the need to always implement the same complex mocking mechanics to preserve the originial element.

Some elements even provide better functions that the original.
